A simple test server to run the Web Workers in browser tests. These tests cannot be run directly loading the file into the browser as it wil throw a security exception.
To start this server you need to install leiningen (https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). 
After installing leiningen, you can run the server with the following command:

$ lein run

The server will be started in port 300.

Leiningen will also take care of downloading the dependencies for the server using Maven.

To run the test suite, point your browser to the following URL: http://localhost:3000/
The tests will only pass if your browser supports WebWorkers.
